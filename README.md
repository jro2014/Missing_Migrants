# Missing_Migrants
This is our group project for IST 687 - Intro to Data Science
Data Source: https://www.kaggle.com/jmataya/missingmigrants


My group and I took a closer look at the Missing Migrants data set found on Kaggle.com (link to the data is located in the github linked below). We came up with a few questions that we wanted to answer from this data:

1. What are statistically the most dangerous routes?
2. What are the different types of circumstances surrounding the deaths and determine the probabilities of each. i.e. What is the likelihood someone will be killed on a specific route and how?
3. What are the demographics of migrants taking each route? i.e. Male, Female; Child, Adult; country of originâ€¦
4. Is there any predictive power within this data to predict the number of migrants that would die on a given route and time of year?

We created prediction models using linear regression, support vector machines, and neural networks to attempt to predict the number of migrants that would die.
